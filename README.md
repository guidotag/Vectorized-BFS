Vectorized-BFS
==============

I've developed a vectorized version of BFS, which I describe in detail in a document. I implemented it in x64 Assembly using SSE extensions, and compared this version with a traditional BFS queue-implementation. Unfortunately, the vectorized BFS turns to be slower than the traditional one. Nevertheless it is theoretically interesting.
